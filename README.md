# Project Manager

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/erose357/project_manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/erose357/project_manager) 

Project Manager is a school project.  I'm trying to create a collaborative project management environment based on my experience in construction management.

* Ruby version
  2.4.1
  Rails 5.1.4

### To initialize the app locally:

`git clone https://github.com/erose357/project_manager`

* Database creation
  `rake db:{create,migrate}`

* Testing with RSpec 
  `rake db:test:prepare`
  `bundle exec rspec`
